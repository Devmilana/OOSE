# Object-Oriented Software Engineering (OOSE)

Part of my Software Engineering degree at Curtin University Colombo in 2024.

This unit focused on **object-oriented design patterns** and **UML-based software design**. My final mark was **85**.

There’s no proper commit history because it wasn’t developed using GitHub.

## Syllabus  

> This unit equips students to **develop and communicate complex object-oriented (OO) design structures** for a given set of software requirements.  
>  
> Key topics covered include:  
> - **Polymorphic design patterns** for **high cohesion & loose coupling**  
> - **Unified Modelling Language (UML)** from design to implementation  
> - **Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture** for separation of concerns  
> - **Containers & generics** for design reuse  
> - **Factories & dependency injection** to enhance testability

## Assignment 1: **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Tool**  

Developed a **tool to assist software engineers** in **work planning and effort estimation**.  

### **Features:**  
✅ Loads and saves a **hierarchical Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**  
✅ Implements **Template & Strategy design patterns**  
✅ Built using **distinct classes, interfaces & containers**  

The application was developed by **first constructing a high-level UML design**, which was then translated into an **object-oriented code implementation**.

---

## Assignment 2: **Bike Shop Simulation**  

Developed a **bike shop simulation** that handles both **sales and repairs**.  

### **Features:**  
✅ Implements **Observer & State patterns** for dynamic updates  
✅ Uses **Factories** for modular object creation  
✅ Ensures **error handling & logging** for system reliability  

The application was designed using **UML**, then implemented in an **object-oriented language** with **clear separation of concerns**.
